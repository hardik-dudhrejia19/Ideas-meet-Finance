The link to the GitLab repository of our application is:

		OR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The functionalities we were able to implement in the prototype of our application are:

	1.Log in/ Register: A user can log in or register for our application using the real-time firebase database.
	2.Ideas Posting: Creative new ideas or requirements by an investor can be posted by the users, which will be displayed on a feed to all the registered members. 
	3.Dashboard: Feed that displays all the ideas by various entrepreneurs or requirements by investors.
	4.Detailed Viewing of an idea: In-depth information can be gained about an idea by clicking on it.
	5.Chat functionality : Messages can be exchanged between entrepreneurs and financiers with this implementation.

Due to the time constraints, we were not able to fulfil the following functionalities:

	1.Implement rating or liking of ideas and sorting them according to the number of likes received by post, onto a userâ€™s feed.
	2.Implement a group chat application for people with common interests.
	3.Implement a subscription plan for entrepreneurs which allows their idea to be visible to more financiers. 
	4.Implementing the patent support for subscribed users.
